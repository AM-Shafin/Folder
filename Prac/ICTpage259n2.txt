2. Given in input an integer N, commmunicate if it is negative, positive or null.

	PROBLEM ANALYSIS

	Problem analysis is similar to the previous one, with  an extra check.
If the number requested in input is greater than zero, then it is positive, 
but if it is not, we cannot say that the numebr is negative: it could be null. 
So let's check if the number could be null. So let's check if the number is less than zero.
If the number is not greater or less than zero, then it is null.

INPUT DATA: N(integer) 
OUTPUT DATA: Massage (The number is positive - The number is negative - The number is null)
